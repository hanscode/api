Our team hits the <a href=\"http:\/\/m.tri.be\/2r\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Forums<\/a> daily.)<\/p>\n<p>Some things to consider before posting on the forum:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn&#8217;t already a discussion going on for your issue.<\/li>\n<li>Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one &#8211; if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you&#8217;ve got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your support request.<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -&gt; Settings -&gt; Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and is worth a shot before creating a new thread.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Still not happy?

AMP enables web experiences that are consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing across distribution platforms. The official AMP plugin for WordPress supports fully integrated AMP publishing for WordPress sites, with robust capabilities and granular publisher controls.<\/p>\n<p>Features and capabilities provided by the plugin include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMP-first Experiences<\/strong>: enabling <a href=\"https:\/\/amp.dev\/about\/websites\" rel=\"nofollow\">full-site AMP experiences<\/a> without sacrificing the flexibility of the platform or the fidelity of content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Core Theme Support<\/strong>: enabling AMP compatibility for all core themes, from Twenty Ten all the way through Twenty Nineteen.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility Tool<\/strong>: when automatic conversion of markup to AMP is not possible, debug AMP validation errors with detailed information including the invalid markup and the specific components responsible on site (e.g theme, plugin, embed); validation errors are shown contextually with their respective blocks in the editor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>CSS Tree Shaking<\/strong>: automatically remove the majority of unused CSS to bring the total under AMP&#8217;s 50KB limit; when the total after tree shaking is still over this limit, prioritization is used so that the all-important theme stylesheet important is retained, leaving less important ones to be excluded (e.g. print styles).<\/li>\n<li>\u2728 <strong>AMP Stories<\/strong> (beta): the AMP plugin enables the creation, editing, and publishing of <a href=\"https:\/\/amp.dev\/about\/stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMP Stories<\/a> in WordPress; leverage the magic of storytelling the WordPress way!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The plugin can be configured to follow one of three different template modes: Standard, Transitional, and Reader. In Standard mode you use AMP as the framework for your site, and there need not be any separate AMP and non-AMP versions. When configured to operate in Reader and Transitional modes, a given page will have a canonical URL as well as a corresponding (paired) AMP URL. The AMP plugin is not serving as a mobile theme; it does not redirect mobile devices to the AMP version. Instead, the AMP version is served to mobile visitors when they find the content on platforms such as Twitter, Pinterest, Google Search, and others. Reader mode only supports serving AMP for singular posts, pages, and other post types, whereas Standard and Transitional mode support serving the entire site as AMP.<\/p>\n<p>With the official AMP plugin for WordPress, the WordPress ecosystem is provided with the capabilities and tools it needs to build world-class AMP experiences without deviating from its standard, flexible, and well-known content creation workflow.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting Started<\/h3>\n<p>To learn more about the plugin and start leveraging its capabilities to power your AMP content creation workflow check <a href=\"https:\/\/amp-wp.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">the official AMP plugin product site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a developer, we encourage you to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ampproject\/amp-wp\" rel=\"nofollow\">follow along<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ampproject\/amp-wp\/blob\/develop\/contributing.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">contribute<\/a> to the development of this plugin on GitHub.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Enable AMP on your WordPress site, the WordPress way.","download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/amp.1.2.2.zip","tags":{"amp":"amp","components":"components","framework":"framework","mobile":"mobile","performance":"performance"},"donate_link":"","icons":{"1x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amp\/assets\/icon-128x128.png?rev=1987390","2x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/amp\/assets\/icon-256x256.png?rev=1987390"},"author_block_count":1,"author_block_rating":72},{"name":"WooCommerce Blocks","slug":"woo-gutenberg-products-block","version":"2.4.1","author":"<a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\">Automattic<\/a>","author_profile":"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/claudiulodro","requires":"5.0","tested":"5.2.3","requires_php":"5.6","rating":44,"ratings":{"5":6,"4":0,"3":1,"2":3,"1":15},"num_ratings":25,"support_threads":20,"support_threads_resolved":17,"active_installs":400000,"downloaded":2902742,"last_updated":"2019-08-30 3:46pm GMT","added":"2018-04-24","homepage":"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block","description":"<p>WooCommerce Blocks are the easiest, most flexible way to display your products on posts and pages!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Featured Product Block<\/strong><br \/>\nSelect and display a single product in a new, high impact fashion.

Here are a few recently added features:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with the WordPress 5.0 Gutenberg block editor (it also stays backwards-compatible with the classic editor). Both the Gutenberg block selector and the Gutenberg classic block will show the YouTube wizard button.  For the Gutenberg block selector, click on the (+) sign for the block editor list. The YouTube Wizard block is located under the &#8220;Embeds&#8221; category (make sure you choose &#8220;YouTube <strong>Wizard<\/strong>&#8220;). See more on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embedplus.com\/embed-youtube-video-gallery-livestream-wordpress-gutenberg-block-editor.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">how to embed a YouTube video, gallery, or livestream with the WordPress Gutenberg block editor here &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Privacy and Consent &#8211; Improved privacy and GDPR compliance options like YouTube no cookie, YouTube API restrictions, and a customizable GDPR consent message<\/li>\n<li>YouTube gallery capability (channel and playlist) \u2013 The ability to make playlist and channel embeds have a gallery layout. By default, the plugin can generate a grid-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embedplus.com\/responsive-youtube-playlist-channel-gallery-for-wordpress.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">responsive playlist or channel gallery &gt;&gt;<\/a>. Your visitors can browse through pages of video thumbnails and choose from videos that are pulled from an entire YouTube channel or playlist.<\/li>\n<li>YouTube gallery auto continuous play &#8211; embed a playlist or channel gallery and allow it to play one video after the next without requiring viewers to click a thumbnail<\/li>\n<li>YouTube Live Stream &#8211; Given a link to a YouTube channel, the plugin wizard automatically finds a livestream if one is active in that channel and generates the embed code for you. On the settings page, you can also set defaults of what to automatically display if a live stream is not active at a given moment. For example, you can have your site display a gallery of a channel&#8217;s entire video library so that users can have something to watch in the meantime. We hope it&#8217;s a time saver.<\/li>\n<li>Improved accessibility by using title attributes for screen reader support. It should help your site pass functional accessibility evaluations (FAE).<\/li>\n<li>Improved ajax theme support<\/li>\n<li>Site origin information with each embed code as an extra security measure. In YouTube&#8217;s\/Google&#8217;s own words, checking this option &#8220;protects against malicious third-party JavaScript being injected into your page and hijacking control of your YouTube player.&#8221; We especially recommend checking it as it adds higher security than the built-in YouTube embedding method that comes with the current version of WordPress (i.e. oembed).<\/li>\n<li>Easy &#8220;Insert&#8221; button for both the Visual and Text mode of the editor (for YouTube gallery and live stream embedding as well)<\/li>\n<li>Embed an entire YouTube channel as a (non-gallery, single embedded player) playlist<\/li>\n<li>Start video settings for playlist embeds. You can now choose to start a playlist with a specific video or have the plugin automatically start with the most recently added video. <strong>Note: If you\u2019re embedding a YouTube gallery, the order will be defined by the order of the channel or playlist on YouTube.com<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.embedplus.com\/mute-volume-youtube-wordpress.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Volume level initialization<\/a> &#8211; helpful when autoplay is checked<\/li>\n<li>iOS playback preferences<\/li>\n<li>Automatic localization\/internationalization so you can set the player&#8217;s interface language from English to another<\/li>\n<li>Instant HTTPS support.

It provides a spectrum of basic and advanced features of the YouTube embedded player and will have you posting videos in seconds after installing it.<\/p>\n<p>The settings page has plenty of default options that you can automatically apply to your embedded YouTube video, gallery, and\/or live stream:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modest branding &#8211; hide YouTube logo while playing (note that the YouTube watermark is shown instead)<\/li>\n<li>Turn on\/off all annotations by default<\/li>\n<li>Automatically center all your videos<\/li>\n<li>Automatically start playing your videos<\/li>\n<li>Autohide controls until hovering<\/li>\n<li>Loop your videos<\/li>\n<li>Show\/hide related videos at the end<\/li>\n<li>Show\/hide the video title and other info<\/li>\n<li>Use the light theme<\/li>\n<li>Show\/hide player controls<\/li>\n<li>Turn on\/off closed captions by default<\/li>\n<li>Make your video, gallery, or live stream responsive so that it dynamically fits in all screen sizes (smart phone, PC and tablet)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Customizations can be also made to each YouTube embed by adding more to the link as shown below. Adding these will override the above global defaults that you set:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>width &#8211; Sets the width of your player. If omitted, the default width will be the width of your theme&#8217;s content. Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;width=500&amp;height=350\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>height &#8211; Sets the height of your player. If omitted, this will be calculated for you automatically. Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;width=500&amp;height=350\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>autoplay &#8211; Set this to 1 to autoplay the video (or 0 to play the video once). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;autoplay=1\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>cc_load_policy &#8211; Set this to 1 to turn on closed captioning (or 0 to leave them off). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;cc_load_policy=1\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>iv_load_policy &#8211; Set this to 3 to turn off annotations (or 1 to show them). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;iv_load_policy=3\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>loop &#8211; Set this to 1 to loop the video (or 0 to not loop). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;loop=1\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>modestbranding &#8211; Set this to 1 to remove the YouTube logo while playing (or 0 to show the logo). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;modestbranding=1\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>rel &#8211; Set this to 0 to not show related videos at the end of playing (or 1 to show them). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;rel=0\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>showinfo &#8211; Set this to 0 to hide the video title and other info (or 1 to show it). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;showinfo=0\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>fs &#8211; Set this to 0 to hide the fullscreen button (or 1 to show it). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;fs=0\"<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also start and end each individual video at particular times. Like the above, each option should begin with &#8216;&amp;&#8217;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>start &#8211; Sets the time (in seconds) to start the video. Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;width=500&amp;height=350&amp;start=20\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>end &#8211; Sets the time (in seconds) to stop the video.

First, you can choose to put restriction on both visual and textual materials. Then, you will be able to see about the popup appearance by choosing the theme and effects to be adjusted to it, the background and text colour, radius of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8221; buttons below the question. Also, you can manage its dimensions and decide on its accessibility on different devices.
